									In the late 1970s, the United States and Colombia embarked on a fierce battle against the Medellin drug cartel. Steve Murphy, a young DEA officer, is doing his best with Javier Peña to bring down Pablo Escobar and his men, despite the massive police corruption that is plaguing Colombia. This struggle is mingled with that of the United States against Communism and many other political interests.
Agent Peña was promoted to head DEA in Colombia after the "success" of Escobar's hunt. At the same time, the Cali cartel has become the leader in the cocaine market. Having infiltrated the high spheres of Colombian society, the cartel intends to redirect its business to legal activities by capitalizing on its immense wealth amassed through drug trafficking. He then began negotiations to his advantage with the Colombian government for his surrender.

											The exact past of Deadpool remains unclear, and several versions have succeeded one another.

Known as Wade Wilson, he lost his father at the age of five. Another version wants his father to abandon him young. Most of his early versions all relate to a difficult childhood. However, the most recent version is that his parents have always been alive and had a normal childhood.

At the age of 19, he worked as an assassin for a secret cell of the CIA. Knowing he was condemned by multiple tumors, he agreed to serve as a guinea pig in the Canadian K Department as part of the Weapon X project. The experiment failed and, considered a waste, he served as a guinea pig to Professor Killbrew who, by play and by sadistic pleasure, endows him with the same power of self-healing as the mutant Wolverine, one of his main enemies. The transplant succeeds, but destroys its skin which takes on a gnawed and cracked appearance. During this period, the experiences of imminent death that he saw allow him to meet Death itself, which he falls in love with. In this institute, his only friend is killed by Ajax, a Killbrew assistant, after Deadpool made fun of his name, "Francis." Ajax then tears the heart of Deadpool to kill him, but this one, in an instinct of vengeance, makes it push back and leaves to avenge itself.
